# Paper-Topic-Chooser
My guitar class assigned a long paper with over a hundred suggested options of topics/people related to the guitar. I'm going to choose the topic based on how much information is available to write and present on them. This will be based on how many words each respective topic's Wikipedia entry contains. (The more words, the merrier!)

If you're curious as to how the paper is turning out: you can see my current writing process of it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STtAsWL6yahJ9qyyT1yxSFRrgQPVb716bAJjeUkqOyI/edit?usp=sharing).

*Here are the results from the second version of the graph with each topic sorted and filtered for topics containing Wikipedia articles over 1499 words:*

## Conclusion
Based on the results and double-checking the Wikipedia pages, Benjamin Britten appears to have more information available for writing about him on the web than the other topics, barring the more ambiguous and open-ended "[t]he first single-string guitars: regional tendencies in France, German lands, and the Holy Roman Empire" which only yielded so many results because it redirected to the mandlolin. Thus, I will write this essay about Benjamin Britten and voyage into the long and arduous journey of learning all about this dashing English composer, conductor and pianist.

## To-do:
- ~Sort tuples~ 
- ~Filter tuples to only include numbers greater than a certain amount of words~
- ~Fix whatever's causing some x-labels to be scooted too far to the left~
- ~Show value of each bar at end of bar~
- Verify the articles are indubitably about the topic by matching the part of the topics with part of the URL link without having to manually verify this
